# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, low-fidelity visual representation of a user interface. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality rather than color, typography, or detailed visuals. Wireframes act as blueprints for the design and development teams and help communicate ideas early in the project.

## Why Wireframing Matters

- **Clarifies layout and structure:** Wireframes show the relative placement of elements and the hierarchy of content.
- **Saves time and cost:** Early feedback on wireframes prevents costly changes later in development.
- **Facilitates collaboration:** Designers, developers, product managers, and stakeholders can align on functionality and user flows before visual design begins.
- **Focuses on user experience (UX):** By stripping away visual design, wireframes prioritize usability and interaction.

## When to Use Wireframes

Use wireframes during the early stages of product or feature planning, before high-fidelity mockups or implementation. They are valuable for:

- Defining user journeys and key interactions.
- Planning responsive layouts for different screen sizes.
- Running usability tests with quick prototypes.

## Common Wireframing Tools

- Pen and paper (fast and flexible)
- Balsamiq
- Figma
- Sketch
- Adobe XD

## How to Get Started

1. Identify the key user goals and tasks for the page or screen.
2. Sketch the layout to define content hierarchy and navigation.
3. Iterate with stakeholders and gather feedback.
4. Convert the wireframe into a higher-fidelity mockup once the structure is approved.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

### 1. Layout Structure
The layout structure defines the **overall arrangement** of components on a page. It determines how users visually navigate the interface and where attention is directed.  
- **Example:** A typical website layout might include a header, main content area, sidebar, and footer. A clear layout helps users find information easily.

### 2. Navigation
Navigation elements help users move between pages or sections of the product. These include menus, buttons, tabs, and links.  
- **Example:** A top navigation bar with “Home,” “About,” and “Contact” guides users smoothly across different parts of a website.

### 3. Content Placement
This defines where text, images, videos, and other content appear on the screen. Proper content placement ensures readability and a logical flow.  
- **Example:** Placing the most important message (like a headline or call-to-action) at the top draws immediate attention and improves engagement.

### 4. Functionality
Functionality represents the interactive elements that allow users to perform actions, such as forms, buttons, and sliders. It shows how the interface will respond to user input.  
- **Example:** A search bar at the top of a page helps users find specific content quickly, improving usability and efficiency.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail depending on the stage of the design process. The two most common types are **Low-Fidelity** and **High-Fidelity** wireframes.

### 1. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are **basic sketches or outlines** that focus on layout and structure rather than visual details. They are quick to create and easy to modify during brainstorming sessions.

**Characteristics:**
- Simple shapes like boxes and lines to represent content.
- No color, images, or typography.
- Focused on overall page structure and functionality.

**When to Use:**
- Early in the design process.
- When exploring multiple layout ideas.
- To get quick feedback from team members or clients.

**Example:**  
A hand-drawn sketch showing a rough layout of a homepage with placeholders for the header, navigation bar, and content area.

### 2. High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are **detailed and polished** representations that closely resemble the final design. They often include typography, spacing, buttons, and images.

**Characteristics:**
- Realistic elements like colors, fonts, and actual text.
- Detailed spacing and alignment.
- May include interactive components.

**When to Use:**
- After layout decisions have been finalized.
- To test usability and visual hierarchy.
- Before moving into prototyping or development.

**Example:**  
A digital mockup created in Figma or Adobe XD showing the final color scheme, icons, and text placement.

## What Type of Wireframe Is This?

The wireframe provided here is a **Low-Fidelity Wireframe** because it emphasizes layout and structure without detailed visuals, color, or interaction. It’s used to define the placement of key elements early in the design process before moving on to high-fidelity stages.
