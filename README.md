# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, low-fidelity visual representation of a user interface. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality rather than color, typography, or detailed visuals. Wireframes act as blueprints for the design and development teams and help communicate ideas early in the project.

## Why Wireframing Matters

- **Clarifies layout and structure:** Wireframes show the relative placement of elements and the hierarchy of content.
- **Saves time and cost:** Early feedback on wireframes prevents costly changes later in development.
- **Facilitates collaboration:** Designers, developers, product managers, and stakeholders can align on functionality and user flows before visual design begins.
- **Focuses on user experience (UX):** By stripping away visual design, wireframes prioritize usability and interaction.

## When to Use Wireframes

Use wireframes during the early stages of product or feature planning, before high-fidelity mockups or implementation. They are valuable for:

- Defining user journeys and key interactions.
- Planning responsive layouts for different screen sizes.
- Running usability tests with quick prototypes.

## Common Wireframing Tools

- Pen and paper (fast and flexible)
- Balsamiq
- Figma
- Sketch
- Adobe XD

## How to Get Started

1. Identify the key user goals and tasks for the page or screen.
2. Sketch the layout to define content hierarchy and navigation.
3. Iterate with stakeholders and gather feedback.
4. Convert the wireframe into a higher-fidelity mockup once the structure is approved.
